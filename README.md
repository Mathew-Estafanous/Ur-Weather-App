<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

[![Ur-Weather App][product-screenshot]](https://localhost:8080)

This project was designed for two main purposes. One being the chance to learn the Vaadin framework and the other being the chance to learn more about REST APIs and how they are used in different applications.

These two major concepts were used to develop a web application that displays relevant weather information for the user. Hourly and Daily weather information is also displayed at the bottom of the website. For extra detail about the weather, you can also open the Details tab.


## Built With

* [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/)
* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [ClimaCell API](https://www.climacell.co/)
* [GeoDB API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started

The following are steps for users who wish to get a local copy of the web application running on their machine.

## Prerequisites

The following needs to be installed on your machine for the application to properly work.
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
    * [Download Tutorial](https://howtodoinjava.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-on-windows/)

## Installation

1. Go to prefered directory
```sh
cd FakeFolder/NotRealDirectory/
```
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mathew-Estafanous/Ur-Weather-App.git
```
3. Run app using maven
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage

The program is very simple and easy to use. Once you open the website page, go to the top navigation bar and input the city you would like to get weather information for.

The format required is as follows:
`City Name, Country Code` (ie. `Vancouver, CA`)

Once you input and click the search button, you can now look through all the displayed information and tab through the detail, hourly and daily weather figures.
